const TOOL_DESCRIPTION = `
Creates a customizable connection between two shapes on the canvas.
The connection can be styled with different arrow heads, line styles, and path types.
Supports connecting any shapes (not just nodes) with full control over the connection appearance.

When connected, the output from the source shape can be sent as input to the target shape.

Returns a JSON object containing the connection properties (sourceShapeId, targetShapeId, startArrowHead, endArrowHead, lineStyle, pathType, sourceAnchor, targetAnchor).

Available options (all optional parameters, provide empty string to use defaults):
- startArrowHead: Arrow style at connection start (FilledTriangle, ConcaveTriangle, OpenArrow, HollowTriangle, FilledDiamond, HollowDiamond, Circle, None)
- endArrowHead: Arrow style at connection end (FilledTriangle, ConcaveTriangle, OpenArrow, HollowTriangle, FilledDiamond, HollowDiamond, Circle, None)
- lineStyle: Line pattern (solid, dashed, dotted)
- pathType: Path rendering (Linear, Bezier, Rounded)
- sourceAnchor: Connection point name on source shape (topLeftPoint, topCenterPoint, topRightPoint, leftCenterPoint, rightCenterPoint, bottomLeftPoint, bottomCenterPoint, bottomRightPoint)
- targetAnchor: Connection point name on target shape (topLeftPoint, topCenterPoint, topRightPoint, leftCenterPoint, rightCenterPoint, bottomLeftPoint, bottomCenterPoint, bottomRightPoint)

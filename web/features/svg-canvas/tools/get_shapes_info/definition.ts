Retrieves information about all shapes in the first level (top-level) of the canvas.
Returns an array of objects containing the ID, center coordinates (x, y), dimensions (width, height), rotation, scale, and optionally name and description of each shape.
Note: x and y represent the center coordinates of the shape, not the top-left corner.
This tool only returns shapes at the first level of the canvas items, not nested shapes within groups.

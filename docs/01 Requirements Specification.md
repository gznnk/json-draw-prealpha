# Requirements Specification

## Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of this software is to accelerate learning using AI.

## Target Audience
The target audience includes students, educators, and lifelong learners who seek to enhance their learning experience through AI-driven tools.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication**: The system must allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles (including: age, language, etc.) and learning purposes.

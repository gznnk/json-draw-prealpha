## Biome Linting and Formatting Rules

- Import Node.js built-in modules using the `node:` protocol prefix (e.g., `import fs from "node:fs"`)
- Use double quotes for strings consistently
- Include trailing commas in multi-line object literals and arrays
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Avoid unused variables and imports
- Use parentheses for nested ternary expressions
- Add spaces around infix operators
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation when variables are involved
- Sort import statements alphabetically
- Avoid console statements in production code (except for proper logging utilities)

## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) Principle

- Do not implement functionality solely on the speculation that it might be needed in the future
- Write the minimum amount of code necessary to meet the current requirements
- Avoid over-engineering with excessive generalization or abstraction
- Do not create extension points or interfaces without concrete use cases
- Embrace refactoring to accommodate changing requirements when they actually arise
- Prioritize simple, readable, and maintainable code over speculative features

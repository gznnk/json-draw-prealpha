## After Copilot Task

- After Copilot finishes generating or modifying code, always run `npm run build` to verify that no build errors were introduced
- If any errors occur, manually fix them before continuing to the next task or committing the code
- This check ensures the codebase remains in a compilable state
- Do not rely solely on Copilot's output—manual validation and correction are required
